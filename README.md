 Time Series Analysis provides a scientific methodology for sales forecasting. Time 
Series Analysis is the analysis of sequential data across equally spaced units of 
time. Time Series is a basic research methodology in which data for one or more 
variables is collected for many observations at different time periods.
The main objectives in Time Series Analysis are:

• To understand the underlying structure of the time series by breaking it down to 
its components.

• Fit a mathematical model and then proceed to forecast the future.

The internal structure of the data may specify a trend, seasonality, or cycles:
Trend component—Trend is a long-term movement in a time series. It is the 
underlying direction—upward or downward—and rate of change in a time series, 
when allowance has been made for the other components.

Seasonal component—Seasonal fluctuations of known periodicity. It is the 
component of variation in a time series that depends on the time of the year.
It 
describes any regular fluctuations with a period of less than one year. For example, 
the costs of various types of fruits and vegetables, and average daily rainfall, all 
show marked seasonal variation.

Cyclic component—Cyclical variations of nonseasonal nature, whose periodicity 
is unknown.

Random component—Random or chaotic values left over when other 
components of the series—trend, seasonal, and cyclical—have been accounted 
for.
 
 Here, you see the steps involved in Time Series Modeling.
